### Description

During this project I worked on the back end of the Event Tracker that will eventually become the newest and greatest way to track your favorite beers and beer events. I got all CRUD operations working in postman and then went back to input error handling. I can now list all beers in my database, find one by its ID, create a new one, update a beer, and also delete one.
